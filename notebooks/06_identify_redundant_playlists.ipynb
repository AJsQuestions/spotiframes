    "Analyze your **user-created playlists** to identify **redundant playlists** with **AGGRESSIVE thresholds** to maximize consolidation without losing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does (AGGRESSIVE MODE):**\n",
    "- 🔍 Finds playlists with high track overlap (>50% similarity - lowered thresholds)\n",
    "- 📊 Identifies playlists that are subsets of other playlists\n",
    "- 🎯 Suggests playlists safe to delete (zero track loss)\n",
    "- 📋 Proposes aggressive reorganization strategies\n",
    "- 💡 Recommends consolidation merges (add missing tracks, zero loss after merge)\n",
    "- 📦 Identifies groups of small playlists that can merge into larger ones\n",
    "- 🔀 **FORCES suggestions** for maximum playlist reduction without information loss\n",
    "- ✅ **EXCLUDES auto-generated \"AJ\" playlists** - these are managed by the sync script\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Changes (Aggressive Mode):**\n",
    "- **Auto-generated exclusion**: All playlists starting with \"AJ\" prefix are excluded from analysis\n",
    "- Lowered similarity thresholds: >70% (was >90%) for high overlap, >50% (was >80%) for near-duplicates\n",
    "- Size-based merge candidates: Small playlists (3x+ smaller) with >50% overlap → merge into larger\n",
    "- Group consolidations: Multiple small playlists can merge into a single larger playlist\n",
    "- **Consolidation strategies**: New strategies for similar playlists (40-50% similarity) with merge/combine/review recommendations\n",
    "- **Zero information loss**: All suggestions preserve all tracks via merge operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** \n",
    "- Run `01_sync_data.ipynb` to download your library\n",
    "- Run `04_analyze_listening_history.ipynb` (optional) to enable listening-based redundancy detection\n"

    "- ✅ Suggested merge strategies for near-duplicates (>50% similarity with size difference)\n",
    "- ✅ Identified size-based merge candidates (3x+ smaller with >50% overlap)\n",
    "- ✅ Found group consolidation opportunities (multiple small playlists → one larger)\n",
    "- ✅ Created aggressive reorganization plan\n",
    "- ✅ Exported recommendations to CSV\n",

    "- **Zero information loss**: All suggestions preserve tracks via merge operations\n",
    "- **Forced suggestions**: Aggressive approach finds more consolidation opportunities\n",

    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Review the recommendations in the CSV file (`playlist_consolidation_recommendations.csv`)\n",
    "2. **For deletions**: Delete playlists - zero track loss (all tracks in another playlist)\n",
    "3. **For merges**: \n",
    "   - Add missing tracks from smaller playlist to larger playlist\n",
    "   - After merging tracks, delete the smaller playlist\n",
    "   - **Zero loss**: All tracks preserved via merge operations\n",
    "4. Review group consolidation opportunities for batch merges\n",
    "5. Re-run `01_sync_data.ipynb` to update your library\n",
    "6. Re-run this notebook to verify cleanup\n",

    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- ✅ **All suggestions preserve information** - zero track loss via merge operations\n",
